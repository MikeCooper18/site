<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="classical-computing">Classical Computing<a class="anchor" href="#classical-computing">#</a></h3>
<p>The classical computer is something we are all familiar with, most, if not all, of us use one every day of our lives. It is well known that a classical computer operates using an expansive array of binary digits, bits, which take discrete values, a 1 or a 0. This is commonly signified by a high or low electrical signal in a computer.</p>
<p>Our classical computers perform operations and store these bits to handle inputs and produce outputs. Logical gates are used which are able to evaluate an expression to be true or false depending if a condition is met. An example of the most common gate is the AND gate, it outputs a high signal, a 1, if both of its inputs are high, a 1. Our computers are built via billions of gates which form circuits and the complex systems required to run our computers today.</p>
<h3 id="quantum-computing">Quantum Computing<a class="anchor" href="#quantum-computing">#</a></h3>
<p>A quantum computer differs in the fact that it does not use regular bits which can only take discrete values. A quantum computer utilises quantum information theory (Datta, 2005) and quantum mechanics to allow differing functionality compared to a classical computer. This quantum functionality allows a quantum computer to outperform a classical computer in vast variety of scenarios and may be the key to advancing our civilisation to new and exotic technologies.</p>
<h3 id="a-brief-history-of-quantum-computing">A Brief History of Quantum Computing<a class="anchor" href="#a-brief-history-of-quantum-computing">#</a></h3>
<p>To understand how and why quantum computing may take our civilisation to new heights we must first understand where the idea came from by exploring a brief timeline of key events in quantum computing&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>The first ideas of using quantum mechanics in a computational sense appeared in the early 1970s when in 1973 Alexander Holevo published a paper explaining that <em>n</em> qubits can simultaneously hold more than <em>n</em> classical bits of information but only <em>n</em> classical bits can be read from, known as Holevo&rsquo;s theorem (Holevo, 1973). This was a major stepping stone into the evolution of quantum computing as it indicated that a quantum computer may actually be advantageous to a classical computer and establishes an upper bound to the amount of information that can be stored about a quantum state.</p>
<p>Advancing on the Shannon Information Theory, Polish physicist Roman Stanislaw Ingarden published the paper &lsquo;Quantum Information Theory&rsquo; in 1975 which shows that the Shannon information theory cannot be applied to the quantum case, and proposed a new theory.</p>
<p>Possibly the most important milestone in quantum computing&rsquo;s history is when in 1980 Paul Benioff first described a quantum mechanical model of a computer. Showing that it is possible that under the laws of quantum mechanics a computer can operate. Benioff achieved this by describing a Schrodinger equation description of a Turing Machine (Benioff, 1980).</p>
<p>Many advancements were made in the following years but the most impactful one was in 1998 when researchers at Oxford University and similarly in the University of California, Berkley demonstrated an actual quantum algorithm working on a 2-qubit quantum computer. This was the first major realisation for the scientific world that quantum computing isn&rsquo;t just theory anymore, they are actually viable systems.</p>
<h2 id="preliminary-knowledge">Preliminary Knowledge<a class="anchor" href="#preliminary-knowledge">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="dirac-notation">Dirac Notation<a class="anchor" href="#dirac-notation">#</a></h3>
<p>In quantum mechanics we often deal with column vectors to represent the state of quantum bits. In classical computing the base states 0 and 1 can be represented as $\col{1 \cr 0}$ and $\col{0 \cr 1}$ respectively. These column vectors can also be represented using Dirac notation (Raymond , et al., 2007) as &lsquo;kets&rsquo; whereby:</p>
<p>$0 = \col{1 \cr 0} = |0&gt;$</p>
<p>$1 = \col{0 \cr 1} = |1&gt;$</p>
<p>In quantum computing a qubits state can be represented as a column vector of complex numbers specifically where this can also be represented as the product of the basis vectors and whereby:</p>
<h3 id="matrix-operations">Matrix Operations<a class="anchor" href="#matrix-operations">#</a></h3>
<p>Matrices are a way of representing operations or transformations on vectors numerically. Take the 4 basic operations applicable to a singular bit for example.</p>
<p>Identity: such that can be represented as and</p>
<p>Negation: such that can be represented as and</p>
<p>Constant-0: such that can be represented as and</p>
<p>Constant-1: such that can be represented as and</p>
<p>In general:</p>
<p>Matrices provide a useful way of representing the operations on quantum bits in a mathematical sense, you can pre-multiply any quantum bits state by the matrix representing the gate to work out the state after the operation.</p>
<h3 id="tensor-product">Tensor Product<a class="anchor" href="#tensor-product">#</a></h3>
<p>The tensor product is a mathematical way of combing vector spaces, that is, the domain that the vectors can exist in by being added and scaled. The tensor product can also be used on vectors, in the sense of quantum computing, it is used to find what is called the product state of 2 or more qubits.</p>
<p>The tensor product is represented by the symbol , and is usually found between two vector spaces or vectors themselves. For example:</p>
<p>Take the vectors and where and , denoting the 2-dimensional complex vector space, their tensor product is defined as:</p>
<p>The operation can also be written as where the tensor product symbol is omitted, or more commonly, when representing multi-qubit systems.</p>
<p>The tensor product of vectors results in a column vector of size The tensor product of 2 vectors can factored back into the original 2 vectors in certain cases, in which specific quantum gates haven&rsquo;t been applied.</p>
<h2 id="how-a-quantum-computer-operates">How a Quantum Computer Operates<a class="anchor" href="#how-a-quantum-computer-operates">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="qubits">Qubits<a class="anchor" href="#qubits">#</a></h3>
<p>Qubits, or quantum bits, are the basis of all quantum computers. Similarly, to classical computers in which regular bits (binary digits) represent the data in a computer, qubits represent the data in a quantum computer.</p>
<p>Qubits exist in the vector space and as mentioned previously the basis vectors are denoted as:</p>
<p>These vectors represent the state of a qubit at a particular instance of time, generally in quantum computing, stands for a vertically polarised photon , while stands for a horizontally polarised photon . Alternatively, the basis vectors, and could also stand for an electron with spin up and spin down respectively. A qubit can be represented by a multiple of physical things, the key idea though is that the thing representing the qubit must experience quantum properties, namely superposition and entanglement.</p>
<h3 id="superposition">Superposition<a class="anchor" href="#superposition">#</a></h3>
<p>Due to quantum mechanics, the things used to represent qubits, such as electrons or photons, experience a phenomenon termed superposition. Superposition allows a qubit to take the values and <em>simultaneously</em> (Nielsen &amp; Chuang, 2010). That is, for example, a photon can be both vertically polarised and horizontally polarised at the same time, a result which seems impossible, but is possible due to quantum mechanics. However, these qubits don&rsquo;t remain in a state of superposition forever.</p>
<p>As soon as a qubit is measured, it instantaneously collapses into one of the two basis states based on respective probabilities. The state of a qubit can be represented as , the probability of a qubit collapsing into state will be , and the probability of the qubit collapsing into state will be . As qubits are a probabilistic system, it is important to note that . Other than that, and can take any value as long as it satisfies the previous statement.</p>
<p>Take the qubit for example, the qubit has a chance of collapsing into and the same probability of collapsing into , it is in equal superposition.</p>
<p>The same applies to multi-qubit systems, for 2 qubits represented by the tensor product:</p>
<h3 id="quantum-gates">Quantum Gates<a class="anchor" href="#quantum-gates">#</a></h3>
<p>For classical computation, the computer operates on a series of bits using a multitude of logic gates. In quantum computation, a quantum computer operates in its qubits via <em>quantum</em> gates, which can take either a single or a multitude of qubits as inputs, perform an operation and produce an output.</p>
<p>The first quantum gate to take note of is the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate (Helwer, 2018). The CNOT gate is a 2-qubit gate which flips the second qubit (the target qubit) if and only if the first qubit (the control qubit) is , leaving the second qubit unchanged if the first qubit is in state . As mentioned previously, quantum gates can be represented as matrices, the CNOT gate is represented by the matrix:</p>
<p>CNOT =</p>
<p>Quantum gates are often represented more visually in a circuit diagram, the CNOT gate above acting on 2 qubits can be represented as:</p>

  <img src="/QuantumComputing/cnot.png" alt="Image here" style="width:auto; height:auto"> 

<p>Another important gate in quantum computing is the Hadamard gate. The Hadamard gate is a special gate as it allows us to take a qubit into equal superposition, where it has an equal probability of collapsing into either a or a . The Hadamard gate also allows us to take a qubit which is in equal superposition and transform it into a basis state (Nakahara, et al., 2008), its operation is its own inverse. We are able to transition in and out of superposition without measurement, we can thusly structure quantum computation deterministically instead of probabilistically.</p>
<p>The Hadamard gate is given by the matrix and its quantum circuit symbol is depicted as:</p>

  <img src="/QuantumComputing/hadamard.png" alt="Image here" style="width:auto; height:auto"> 

<h3 id="entanglement">Entanglement<a class="anchor" href="#entanglement">#</a></h3>
<p>Entanglement is a key property in quantum computing. When you measure, and collapse, an entangled qubit, simultaneously and instantaneously, the other qubit also collapses. This allows us to determine the state of the other qubit without measurement, the qubits are said to be correlated. The same effect occurs for any changes made to an entangled qubit, when a change is made, the same change is also experienced in the other entangled qubit, this allows us to exploit this daisy chain behaviour for an exponential speed up in quantum computation (Giles, 2019).</p>
<p><img src="RackMultipart20220412-4-71b70s_html_36392ae81f30ace6.gif" alt="IMAGE HERE"></p>
<p>Apply the Hadamard gate to the first Qubit</p>
<p><img src="RackMultipart20220412-4-71b70s_html_c9ff33480cd61ca2.png" alt="IMAGE HERE">
Qubits are said to be entangled if the product state of the qubits cannot be factorised, but how do we arrive at this entangled state? Well suppose we have 2 qubits both in state , we can entangle these qubits by passing them through the following circuit:</p>

  <img src="/QuantumComputing/entanglement.png" alt="Image here" style="width:auto; height:auto"> 

<p>Apply the CNOT gate to the product state</p>
<p>The circuit is simply applying the Hadamard gate to the first qubit, then applying a controlled-NOT gate with the first qubit as the control and the second as the target. The maths behind this entanglement is as follows:</p>
<p>The resulting product state <em>cannot</em> be factorised into the product of 2 individual qubits, therefore the qubits are entangled, and have a correlation in behaviour. This correlation of behaviour even occurs across vast distances of space, faster than the speed of light, it is instantaneous. This concept does break locality; however, no information can be communicated between the qubits.</p>
<h2 id="restrictions-of-operation">Restrictions of Operation<a class="anchor" href="#restrictions-of-operation">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="decoherence">Decoherence<a class="anchor" href="#decoherence">#</a></h3>
<p>Decoherence is the process in which environment causes various changes in the quantum system, which manifests itself as undesirable noise (Nakahara, et al., 2008). Simply put, a quantum system, such as a quantum computer, is constantly in interaction with its surrounding environment. This interaction alters the state of the quantum system, resulting in a loss of information which is stored in the system. Noise is a major issue in quantum computing which many researchers are aiming to solve.</p>
<p>This interaction can cause the qubits in the quantum system to be knocked out of superposition or changed in an unwanted way, making quantum computation practically useless. If we have to deal with an overwhelming abundance of errors, how can we be sure that our answers are correct during calculations?</p>
<h3 id="methods-to-combat-noise">Methods to Combat Noise<a class="anchor" href="#methods-to-combat-noise">#</a></h3>
<p>A few methods have been developed to overcome noise, the most prominent being cooling the whole system to temperatures near absolute zero, approximately -273C. By doing this, the vibrations of surrounding matter are reduced to negligible amounts, reducing the overall noise in the system and improving stability. Noise can also come from imperfections in the circuitry that is used within the systems producing stray magnetic fields. Recently developments in inducing superconductive behaviour in gold (Wei, et al., 2019) has been theorised as a potential tool which can be utilised to reduce the overall noise. However, this comes at a high cost, spending millions on researching new materials and new methods which may not prove to be useful is a hard buy for many.</p>
<h2 id="error">Error<a class="anchor" href="#error">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="error-checking-amp-correction">Error checking &amp; correction<a class="anchor" href="#error-checking-amp-correction">#</a></h3>
<p>It is impossible to create a system which is error-free 100% of the time, it is guaranteed that there will be errors eventually no matter what procedures you put in place to prevent them. This is where error <em>correction</em> comes into place. Just like in classical computing, there have been a series of quantum error correction codes (QECC) devised for quantum computing.</p>
<p>In classical computation, the majority voting system is often put in place. Majority voting works by the transmitter sending identical copies of each bit an odd number of times, 3 for example, the receiver then counts how many of each bit a 1 or a 0 have appeared and takes the actual logical value to be the most common bit. The caveat is that this only works if 1 bit in each group is erroneous in the example of 3 bits per group.</p>
<p>This system doesn&rsquo;t translate into quantum computing very well though, and that is due to the no-cloning theorem (Park, 1970) which states that &lsquo;it is impossible to create and identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state&rsquo;. Instead a QECC called the 3-Qubit Bit-flip code (Nakahara, et al., 2008) is used. The basis of this code is applying a multitude of CNOT operations on basis states of the source qubit and ancillary qubits to replicate the basis states. An input of should produce an output of , essentially allowing the quantum computer to detect where the error has occurred and fix them. The circuit can be seen below:

  <img src="/QuantumComputing/ecc.png" alt="Image here" style="width:auto; height:auto"> 
</p>
<h3 id="qubit-requirements">Qubit Requirements<a class="anchor" href="#qubit-requirements">#</a></h3>
<p>It is important to mention that many QECC use many physical qubits to represent a single logical qubit. With numbers of physical qubits to represent a single logical qubit ranging from 7 to 100s. Currently, we have quantum computers with qubits ranging from 30 upwards to 100. Estimates put it that somewhere in the range of 1,000 to 100,000 <em>logical</em> qubits (Dyakonov, 2018) will be needed for a useful quantum computer in the future. Adding on the physical to logical qubit requirement, the number of qubits needed can jump into values in the millions. These estimated values show us just how much further the field of quantum computing needs to advance in order for useful quantum computers to be viable. On the contrary, it also shows how the amount of potential quantum computing has to offer us.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-quantum-computing">Advantages of Quantum Computing<a class="anchor" href="#advantages-of-quantum-computing">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="exponential-speed-up">Exponential speed up<a class="anchor" href="#exponential-speed-up">#</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, quantum computers provide an exponential speed up in the time of operations in comparison to classical computation. But how exactly does it provide this exponential speed up in computation? The answer to that question is quantum parallelism. Quantum parallelism is a very powerful idea that makes use of superposition, the basis of all quantum computers. Given an input , a quantum computer will compute in the following way:</p>
<p>Where is the unitary matrix that implements .</p>
<p>Say that acts on an input qubit which is in a superposition of states. Since is a linear operator, will <em>simultaneously</em> act on <em>all</em> of the vectors which make the superposition of the input qubit. This operation produces an output qubit which is also in a superposition of all possible output states.</p>
<p>The unitary transformation acts on a qubit in a superposition of states. This superposition of states is produced by the application of a Hadamard gate on an -qubit register in an all zero state, i.e. resulting in an equal superposition of states:</p>
<p>The linear operation of then leads to:</p>
<p>The resulting superposition is made of states, meaning a quantum computer can compute with all of those states simultaneously making quantum computation exponentially faster than classical computation in certain types of computation (Nakahara &amp; Ohmi, 2008).</p>
<h3 id="quantum-supremacy">Quantum Supremacy<a class="anchor" href="#quantum-supremacy">#</a></h3>
<p>Quantum supremacy is the goal of demonstrating that a quantum computer can solve a problem that is feasibly unsolvable on a classical computer (Preskill, 2012). More specifically, that a quantum computer provides an exponential time speed up in a computation that would take a classical computer thousands of years to complete. In layman&rsquo;s terms, quantum supremacy will be achieved when a quantum computer completes a calculation a classical computer is not able to due to a lack of computational power.</p>
<p>In 2019 Google claimed that they had achieved quantum supremacy with their sycamore processor which consisted of 54 qubits, 53 of which were operational. They claimed the quantum computer had performed a calculation in 200 seconds which would take a supercomputer about 10,000 years to complete (Arute, et al., 2019). However, IBM responded to their claims saying that they were excessive and that their supercomputer could solve the problem in about 2.5 days instead of 10,000 years (IBM, 2019).</p>
<h3 id="quantum-algorithms">Quantum Algorithms<a class="anchor" href="#quantum-algorithms">#</a></h3>
<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t have much use for a quantum computer without some quantum specific algorithms to execute on it. Perhaps the most basic quantum algorithm is the Deutsch Algorithm. As mentioned previously, we have the 4 basic operations which can be performed on a single bit: constant-0, constant-1, identity and negation. Let us classify them into 2 categories, constant consisting of constant-0 and constant-1, and balanced consisting of identity and negation. Say we wanted to determine which operation we had in a black box we know nothing about, we only send in an input and it returns an output. In a classical computer it would take at least 2 queries to determine which category the operation fell into, but with quantum computation it is possible to determine it in one query (Deutsch &amp; Jozsa, 1992). The Deutsch algorithm was one of the first quantum algorithms which showcased that quantum computers may be more efficient then their classical counterparts.</p>
<p>Grover&rsquo;s algorithm is a quantum algorithm which is commonly named Grover&rsquo;s search algorithm as that is its most common use case. More generally, Grover&rsquo;s algorithm works to find the input to a function which produces the desired, or correct, output. Grover&rsquo;s algorithm is beneficial as it can find the correct input with a high probability in just evaluations of the function (Bennett, et al., 1997), where is the domain (set of all possible input values) of the function. In classical computation, this problem cannot be solved in fewer than evaluations. This shows that Grover&rsquo;s algorithm provides a quadratic speed up, which is often less than other quantum algorithm speed up&rsquo;s but due to Grover&rsquo;s algorithm&rsquo;s wider use-case, it is often see as more useful. The basis behind Grover&rsquo;s algorithm is that it increases the amplitude of the correct inputs vector whilst it decreases the amplitude of the incorrect solutions in an iterative process, overall, this increases the probability that the correct answer will be measured when the qubit in superposition is measured.</p>
<h2 id="the-future-of-quantum-computing">The Future of Quantum Computing<a class="anchor" href="#the-future-of-quantum-computing">#</a></h2>
<p>Quantum computing is a field which has had many breakthroughs over the past 4 decades it has existed. With some small breakthroughs with no practical use and other larger breakthroughs which may determine the way our civilisation behaves in the future. With more and more highly intelligent scientists joining the field every year, it is highly likely that quantum computing will see the next major breakthrough in the upcoming decade which will make or break the field.</p>
<p>For now, let&rsquo;s take a brief look at one of the more recent discoveries in the field of quantum computing and where it might lead. A very recent advancement made in the field comes from researchers at MIT and others have proposed a theory which may bypass the greatest difficulty currently faced in quantum computation, noise. They proposed a system that use non-linear optic crystals and photonic circuits to act as quantum logic gates (The Army Research Laboratory, 2020). They propose that this system will be able to run at room temperature as the photons which act as qubits won&rsquo;t be interfered by rouge electrical fields or charges, the main issue in current quantum computing systems. The idea behind this system is that the crystals will have cavities which can trap and store photons, as photons themselves experience quantum behaviour, namely superposition, the crystals are also able to act in a state of superposition, the core functionality behind a quantum computer. However, with further breakthroughs needed in the field of non-linear optics, this theory will remain as imperfect computer simulations for the time being.</p>

<h3 id="cost-amp-resources">Cost &amp; Resources<a class="anchor" href="#cost-amp-resources">#</a></h3>
<p>The field of quantum computing is being researched by many at large companies like IBM, Google and Microsoft as well as educational institutions such as MIT, the University of Sydney and the University of Oxford to name a few examples. With so much research taking place, a vast amount of funding is behind it. It is expected that by 2024 the quantum computing market will take a value of $10.7 Billion (Homeland Security Research, 2017). With so much money being spent on the field and with the little current progress made with narrow use-cases, people are starting to wonder whether quantum computing is worth the billions of dollars being spent on it. They argue that surely the money is better spent on necessary causes such as homeless or malnutrition.</p>
<p>But why is quantum computing so expensive? Well the building blocks of a quantum computer are qubits. And qubits are very temperamental, not responding well to external noise as mentioned previously. In order to combat noise, the system needs to be cooled to very low temperatures, this is an expensive process as it requires a copious amount of liquid helium.</p>
<h3 id="encryption-amp-privacy">Encryption &amp; Privacy<a class="anchor" href="#encryption-amp-privacy">#</a></h3>
<p>The RSA encryption system is used by many companies and governments alike. The system utilises a public key and a private key. The user of RSA publishes the public key which is based on 2 very large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message, but only someone with knowledge of the prime numbers can decode a message. The strength behind RSA encryption comes in attempting to factor the large public key based on the product of prime numbers. In 1994, Peter Shor developed what is known as Shor&rsquo;s Algorithm. Shor&rsquo;s algorithm is a polynomial time quantum computer algorithm for integer factorisation. It solves the problem, given an integer find its prime factors. RSA was based on the fact that factoring large numbers was computationally intractable. Whilst this is the case for classical computation, in quantum computation it is feasible using Shor&rsquo;s algorithm. The importance behind this algorithm and the fact we are moving towards stable quantum computers with many qubits is that a quantum computer could be used to break RSA encryption, posing a threat to many services provided. Currently, many people are working towards &lsquo;post-quantum encryption&rsquo; that is, encryption which still remains secure even against quantum computation.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="anchor" href="#summary">#</a></h2>
<p>To summarise, quantum computing works on the basis of quantum mechanics and its respective properties experienced by qubits (quantum bits). Through a variety of operations, the state of these qubits can be manipulated and measured. However, qubits are very delicate and require very specific conditions for operation over any useful length of time. The idea of widescale quantum computing seems unfeasible at this current time, due to the restrictions of operation, a quantum computer requires very strict monitoring and conditions to run. But wasn&rsquo;t that the census with classical computers in the beginning, they were room-sized temperamental machines possessed by only wealthy companies and educational institutes. Does that not sound like the current state of quantum computing today? But as we are all aware, everyone has a multitude of classical computers in their very own home. So, what&rsquo;s stopping quantum computers from being a staple in <em>our</em> future?</p>
<p>Quantum computing is a field with a vast number of brilliant minds, supported by governmental and private funding, all researching with the same goal in mind. To make quantum computing as much of a crucial part of our lives in the future as classical computing is to us now. We are just waiting for the next Turing, the next Hopper, the next vacuum tube, the next transistor to revolutionise what we know and understand quantum computing to be. It&rsquo;s only a matter of time before widescale quantum computing <em>is</em> a viable part of <em>our</em> future.</p>
