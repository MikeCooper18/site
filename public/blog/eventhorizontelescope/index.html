<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="anchor" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>A black hole is a region of the fabric of the universe known as spacetime in which the attractive gravitational force is so strong that nothing, no particles or radiation, is able to escape (1) once it is past its boundary called the event horizon. As no light is able to escape the black hole, previously it has been impossible to visualize what an actual black hole is. As gaseous matter is pulled into a black hole it forms a very large disk due to the rotational motion of the black hole. Accretion disks are very energetic regions with strong magnetic forces causing turbulent behavior resulting in the gases heating up (2). Photons of varying wavelengths are emitted from the hot gas which are manipulated by the gravitational attraction of the black hole – lensed to be put scientifically. It is these photons which we are able to see and measure to produce an image of a black hole, or more specifically – its shadow.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background<a class="anchor" href="#background">#</a></h2>
<p>We live in a galaxy called the Milky Way, at the center of our galaxy is a very massive black hole deemed Sagittarius A*, or Sgr A* for short. This black hole at the center of our galaxy has a mass of approximately 4million solar masses (the mass of our sun, ) and is located 26000 light years away from Earth (3). On the grand scheme of things, Sgr A* is a relatively small black hole, as there are black holes at the center of other galaxies with masses in the range of billions of solar masses.</p>
<p>Messier 87 is a giant elliptical galaxy in the Virgo constellation. Similarly, to Sgr A*, there is a supermassive black hole at the center of M87. In fact, it is one of the most massive supermassive black holes discovered, with a mass of 6.5 billion times the mass of our sun and 1500 times the mass of Sgr A* the black hole at the center of our galaxy. However, it is at a distance of 50 million light years away from the Earth. Although M87 is a greater distance away than Sgr A*, its much greater mass means that it is observed to roughly be the same size as Sgr A*(4).</p>
<h2 id="the-event-horizon-telescope">The Event Horizon Telescope<a class="anchor" href="#the-event-horizon-telescope">#</a></h2>
<p>The Event Horizon Telescope, EHT, is a large global array of radio telescopes all across the world. It combines the observational power and data collected from several very long baseline interferometers around the world providing an angular resolution sufficient enough to observe the size of a supermassive black hole&rsquo;s event horizon.</p>
<p>The angular resolution of a telescope is the ability to distinguish between narrowly separated objects. The angular resolution of an interferometer can be calculated using the formula where is the wavelength of the observed radiation and is the size of the telescope dish. In the case of the EHT, this formula is adapted slightly, as the EHT utilizes an array of interferometers all across the globe, becomes the <em>maximum</em> distance between any two interferometers. This effectively gives us a telescope which has a dish the size of the Earth, something which is currently highly unfeasible to actually build. Due to this, the EHT has an angular resolution of approximately operating at a wavelength of 1.3mm. Sufficient enough to resolve both M87 and Sgr A* (2).</p>
<p>A telescope array is able to observe more detailed information about its target as the separation between the telescopes is increased. The resolution of a baseline (telescope pair) is given by as mentioned previously from this formula we can clearly see that to improve the resolution of an interferometer pair, you can either increase the distance between the pair or decrease the wavelength in which the telescopes observe at. Whilst observing M87, the EHT operated at a nominal wavelength of . This wavelength was used as it is able to pass through the dense accretion disk whilst longer wavelengths are not. It would become impractical if a smaller wavelength were to be measured as irregularities in the dishes surface would become an issue due to the lack of highly precise manufacturing processes (5).</p>
<h2 id="very-long-baseline-interferometry-vlbi">Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)<a class="anchor" href="#very-long-baseline-interferometry-vlbi">#</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned, the Event Horizon Telescope makes use of a process called very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) to record data about the source being observed. The principle of VLBI is to connect radio telescopes some distance away to create a singular virtual telescope. This allows baselines similar lengths to the size of the Earth, significantly boosting the angular resolution of the virtual telescope.</p>

  <img src="/EHT/pic1.png" alt="Image here" style="width:auto; height:auto"> 

<p>To understand how VLBI works further let&rsquo;s take a look at a simple radio interferometer, that is two dishes directed at the same target as in the diagram below. Radio waves from a distant source such as a star or black hole reach the antenna on the right at a time before the other. The data signals are then combined in a correlator that multiplies and averages the signals together, the output being a complex number in which the magnitude represents the intensity of the source and the phase is given by , where is the wavelength of the measured radio waves and is the speed of light. The phase is a full rotation for each wavelength of extra path length the radio waves have to travel to reach the second more distance antenna. From this can we deduce a relationship between interferometer phase and position on the sky: if the sources changes in position on the sky by an angle (where is the distance between the antennas projected in the direction of the source) the phase changes by a full cycle. The interferometer has an angular resolution of which is equivalent to a regular radio telescope whose diameter is . By adding a delay to the electronic signal at the rightmost antenna, we can zero the phase for a particular direction of source. Thusly showing that by having an array of interferometers around the globe, we can produce a virtual radio telescope whose dish is the size of the Earth allowing us to observe finer detail about cosmic radiation sources.</p>
<p>Each interferometer is only able to collect data along one dimension of the radiation source. And is unable to resolve cosmic structures which are larger than . To overcome this, arrays of antennas are constructed to sample a multitude of orientations. Take the Very Large Array in New Mexico, which is comprised of 27 separate radio dishes all connected together to give 351 () interferometer pairs. As the each rotates the array&rsquo;s orientation changes with respect to the source being observed so that many more interferometers pairs can be sampled during a period of observation.</p>
<p>To be able to observe and discern detail about a black hole for example, the radio dishes are required to be spaced out all across the globe, and the data must be collated at a central location. Unlike the VLA in New Mexico, it is impossible to do this with cables connecting the dishes, so another method must be used. At each observation site about of the EHT, atomic clocks are used to time-stamp the recorded data so that each signal can be correctly compared once it has all be brought together. With so many radio dishes all collaborating on the EHT, masses of data are produced (64 Giga-bites per second) which must all be interpreted to produce an actual image of the source being observed (2).</p>
<h2 id="imaging">Imaging<a class="anchor" href="#imaging">#</a></h2>
<p>Collecting the data needed to produce the image of a black hole is only one small part of the task, the real challenge is in constructing an image from the collected data. The data is extremely sparse and contains vast amounts of noise which must be filtered out. In order to produce these images, statistical computer modelling is used to fill in the gaps between collected data points.</p>

  <img src="/EHT/pic2.png" alt="Image here" style="width:auto; height:auto"> 

<p>Let&rsquo;s first take a look at what the data captured from the Black Hole is recorded as. The measurements from each interferometer pair are all collated at one location and plotted in the frequency plane, by taking the Fourier transform of the data, as seen in the adjacent diagram. With U, the East-West frequency on the x-axis, and V, the North-South frequency on the y-axis. Now if the EHT had telescopes at every position on the globe the resulting frequency plane graph would look like a circle, but as there are only a smaller number of telescopes, 8 to be specific, at 6 different locations. This allows the EHT to take 6C2=15 different measurements at any one time. This data would be too sparse to reconstruct any image from. However, as the Earth rotates in relation to the target source, M87, more measurements are able to be taken which carves out the elliptical paths seen in the image above (6).</p>
<p>Traditionally, a method called CLEAN is used to reconstruct images from data collected about celestial bodies via VLBI. Essentially CLEAN works by putting a zero at any point in the frequency plane which there isn&rsquo;t a recorded measurement for. It then applies an inverse Fourier transform on the data which results in an image being produced. However, this image contains a lot of noise and only vaguely resembles the actual image of the source being captured, the generated image will share some similar features such as shape in comparison to the actual image. After that, a few steps are taken to try and refine the image created. First, an assumption is made that the image consists of multiple point sources of radiations, the image is then iteratively searched to find the brightest point in the image and to remove the artifacts that would occur due to incomplete sampling in the frequency plane. Once multiple point sources are left, the image is blurred so that all the point sources combine into an extended source – this process results in the final image. However, the CLEAN method works best when there are a lot of telescopes pointed at the source and are capturing at longer wavelengths than that which was used by the EHT to observer M87. CLEAN also requires a lot of guidance from a knowledgeable which can be a very time consuming and biased process (7).</p>
<p>A new approach was introduced to attempt to reconstruct the image from the data collected by the EHT. This approach deemed CHRIP takes a Bayesian approach to creating the image. It works by finding an inverse function to create an image which fits the measurements, of which there are an infinite number of possibilities, but is also likely to produce the actual image. But here we reach an issue in defining what a likely image actually is without pressuring the algorithm to produce the image we expect to see, instead of what is actually seen.</p>
<p>Using VLBI across the globe like the EHT introduces a few errors which must be accounted for. It is possible to incorporate these types of errors, such as phase error, noise and amplitude error, into the function which determines the likelihood of an image being viable. The main way in which this is done is by incorporating closure quantities, that is quantities which are invariant to the calibration terms mentioned previously.</p>
<p>Phase error is introduced due to the inhomogeneities in the atmosphere causing the light to travel at different velocities to each telescope in the interferometer. An observation, termed phase closure, is able to counteract these adverse effect however. If we take the ideal visibility measurements (spatial frequency measurements) from three different telescopes and multiply them, the additional phase terms introduced by the atmosphere cancels out leaving an expression which is invariant to the atmosphere, as if the atmosphere doesn&rsquo;t even exist. This product of visibilities is referred to as the bispectrum (8).</p>
<p>Amplitude error is also introduced by the atmosphere as well as a variety of other errors such as pointing error or the telescope being out of focus. Each interferometer is going to have a different attenuation due to the atmosphere and therefore its visibility measurement is going to have a different absolute gain term. Amplitude closure can also be introduced by multiplying and dividing the measurements of four telescopes in a certain way so that the gain terms also cancel out resulting in a term as if the gains were all one (9).</p>
<p>The different closure quantities mentioned previously were all developed prior and mainly used for the calibration of the data collected by VLBI before imaging, what the EHT team did differently was that they factored the calibration directly into the imaging process so that calibration is done at the same time as imaging.</p>
<p>As the imaging process includes a likelihood factor of an image being possible, the process must be biased by a human in some way. Error checking to avoid imposing too much bias on the algorithm to produce what we want not what is actually there was a process in which the EHT team spent a lot of time on.</p>
<p>The first step which was executed was to perform synthetic data tests. This step started off by generating measurements from real images which were then passed to different teams of people to attempt to reconstruct their best interpretation of the data without knowing what the truth image was using whichever method they would like. The generated image from each team was then passed to a panel of experts who evaluated the images to assess the quality and decide what they believe by looking at common features and irregularities between the images. They also compared the generated images to the truth image in which the measurements were generated from to determine how effective each algorithm was. But they didn&rsquo;t just test on images of celestial bodies they also tested on random images such as an image of a snowman to test the effectiveness of each method further and whether it would produce something we didn&rsquo;t expect, which was a possibility for the first ever image of a black hole.</p>
<p>The second step of the error checking process was focused on blind imaging. The members of the EHT collaboration were divided into 4 different teams, with 2 teams focusing on the traditional CLEAN method and self-calibration of the data and the other 2 teams focusing on a Regularized Maximum Likelihood procedure, that being the CHIRP method. A website was set up in which the team could submit the images they produced, practice ones at first of active galactic nuclei, which would provide diagnostics about their submitted image so that the teams could compare results without actually seeing the other teams&rsquo; images to avoid bias. Once the practice period was over, each team got an engineering copy of the actual data collected from M87 by the EHT. For 7 weeks they would then work to perfect their image generated, still without seeing what the other teams had produced. At the end of the 7 weeks, the teams all came together to present their created images to the other teams and compare. All 4 teams had produced an image which was similar to the other teams, showing that what they were creating was likely to be correct (10).</p>
<p>
  <img src="/EHT/pic3.png" alt="Image here" style="width:auto; height:auto"> 

The penultimate step was to objectively choose the best imaging parameters for different imaging pipelines. 3 different imaging pipelines were developed based on three different software, DIFMAP (CLEAN + Self-Calibration), eht-imaging and SMILI which were two libraries written in Python which used a Regularized Maximum Likelihood approach. Each pipeline had a set of imaging parameters in which the EHT team attempted to find the optimal value(s) for. To do this, they trained on a toy data set, consisting of images such as a disk and a ring, to find the parameters which best reproduced the original image in the toy data set. These parameters were then transferred onto the actual M87 data. The result was a reconstructed image which still had a hole in the center, as the M87 data should. Once the best imaging parameters were found for each pipeline method, they were applied to the imaging process for all the four days of M87 data and produced the images below.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/EHT/pic4.png" alt="Image here" style="width:auto; height:auto"> 

Due to irregularities in the imaging process and to avoid the general public over-interpreting the images produced, the images from each pipeline were all blurred until they were all consistent.</p>
<p>
  <img src="/EHT/pic5.png" alt="Image here" style="width:auto; height:auto"> 

The 3 images from each pipeline were then averaged together to produce the final image of M87 which was shown to the public seen adjacent (11).</p>
<p>The final stage of the imaging process was validating the generated image. The first basic validation test was comparing the images produced from each of the 4 days in which M87 was observed. All 4 images are consistent suggesting that the method is reliable. As mentioned previously, models were trained to find the best set of imaging parameters, but in the domain of over 100,000 parameters that were searched over, there is guaranteed to be different sets of parameters which can be considered reasonable. To find these sets of parameters a comparison was made based on the results of an imaging method for that set of parameters. If the normalized cross correlation between the true images (from toy data) and the truth images blurred to the resolution of the telescope was less than the normalized cross correlation between the true images and the generated images based on that specific set of parameters, then the set of imaging parameters was acceptable. Once the sets of acceptable imaging parameters were found it, was possible to compare the generated images together created from the top sets of parameters by looking at statistics such as the fractional standard deviation, which was often found to be small, suggesting further that the results are correct. A variety of other validation techniques were used mainly focused about comparing the results for the different methods, such as comparing the diameter of the ring produced which was found to be consistent throughout all methods (12).</p>
<h2 id="results">Results<a class="anchor" href="#results">#</a></h2>
<p>So, what did the effort and resources of many countries, people and resources provide? Well for one, it produced the first ever image of a black hole. From the image constructed of M87 we are able to deduce the diameter of M87, that being . From this we are also able to calculate the mass of M87 more accurately. Using the equation , where is the gravitational constant, is the mass of M87, is the distance to the black hole and is the speed of light. 5.2 is the lensing factor due to the gravitational lensing of M87 which makes the ring appear bigger. From these results the mass of M87 is approximate 6.6 billion solar masses. Directly from the image we are also able to tell that the gas on the bottom of black hole is moving towards us, we can deduce this as it appears brighter due to doppler boosting.</p>
