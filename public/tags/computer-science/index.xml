Introduction Classical Computing The classical computer is something we are all familiar with, most, if not all, of us use one every day of our lives. It is well known that a classical computer operates using an expansive array of binary digits, bits, which take discrete values, a 1 or a 0. This is commonly signified by a high or low electrical signal in a computer.
Our classical computers perform operations and store these bits to handle inputs and produce outputs.</description>
