      <description>Introductions Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Michael a first year Computer Science student at the University of Warwick and this is my first attempt at creating a personal website and blog!
A bit about myself first. I am 19 years old and live in a town called Warrington in the beautiful Cheshire countryside. Ideal location for trips to Manchester and Liverpool!
I am also a student at the Univeristy of Warwick. I study Computer Science and have always been interested by computers, how they work and the many amazing things you can do with them!</description>
