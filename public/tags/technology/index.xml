Introduction Classical Computing The classical computer is something we are all familiar with, most, if not all, of us use one every day of our lives. It is well known that a classical computer operates using an expansive array of binary digits, bits, which take discrete values, a 1 or a 0. This is commonly signified by a high or low electrical signal in a computer.
Our classical computers perform operations and store these bits to handle inputs and produce outputs.</description>

      <description>Introduction A black hole is a region of the fabric of the universe known as spacetime in which the attractive gravitational force is so strong that nothing, no particles or radiation, is able to escape (1) once it is past its boundary called the event horizon. As no light is able to escape the black hole, previously it has been impossible to visualize what an actual black hole is. As gaseous matter is pulled into a black hole it forms a very large disk due to the rotational motion of the black hole.</description>
